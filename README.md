# AI/Machine Learning Project Portfolio

Practical implementations of machine learning fundamentals, showcasing hands-on skills with algorithms, data processing, and model evaluation. Based on Microsoft's AI For Beginners curriculum. The following projects are capstone projects given as an assignment from the Microsoft's AI For Beginners course which is solved by Carlos Berlin Arifin as a part of my learning process in learning AI. These projects tackle advanced topics that go beyond typical beginner content.
